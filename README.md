# Fan_control_system_using_AVR_micorcontroller
this project is implemented by software layered concept to abstract the microcontroller , hardware and application layers.
by using analog temperature sensor we convert the temperature to corresponding voltage based on this reading we use PWM driver to control the speed of our motor
# project description
The aim of this project is to design a temperature-controlled fan using ATmega16<br />
microcontroller, in which the fan is automatically turned ON or OFF according to the <br />
temperature. Use ATmega16 Microcontroller with frequency 1Mhz.<br />
- the LM35 temperature sensor will give continuous analog output <br />
corresponding to the temperature sensed by it. This analog signal is given to the ADC, 
which converts the analog values to digital values.

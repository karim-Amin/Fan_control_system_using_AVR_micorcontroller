# Fan_control_system_using_AVR_micorcontroller
this project is implemented by software layered concept to abstract the microcontroller , hardware and application layers.
by using analog temperature sensor we convert the temperature to corresponding voltage based on this reading we use PWM driver to control the speed fo our motor
